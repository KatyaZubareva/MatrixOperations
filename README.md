# MatrixOperations

This project provides a C# program that performs operations on a matrix of integers, including:

- Generating a random matrix.
- Calculating the product of elements at even indices.
- Finding and summing elements between the first and last zero in the matrix.
- Creating a new array with positive elements followed by negative elements.

## Features

- **GenerateRandomMatrix()**: Fills the matrix with random integers between -100 and 100.
- **EvenComp()**: Computes the product of elements at even indices.
- **FindZeros()**: Returns the number of zeros and their positions.
- **SumCount(int count, int firstZero, int lastZero)**: Sums elements between the first and last zero.
- **ChangedArray()**: Creates an array with positive numbers followed by negative numbers.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MatrixOperations.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd MatrixOperations
3. Build and run the program using your preferred C# development environment or the command line.
